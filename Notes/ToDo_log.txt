0. data stream stopped in the middle of a movie - not polling data from buffer fast enough

    0.1 nested thread - read data and emit signal when the correct number of sample is collected - bad idea
        - saved in pyRTAOI-20180620_1; this guaranteed data streaming from PV but it takes more time to process one frame, 35 ms without nested thread; 60 ms with
    0.2 use queue to communicate between worker and streamer - done
        - saved in pyRTAOI-20180620_2; < 20 ms when running offline; need to test on rig
    0.3 use gpu for motion correction? - caiman motion correction is below 10 ms; good enough

    - down sample by 2 kept up with 30Hz image stream

1. log data for offline anaysis - photostimulation targets and frame idx; save online analysis result - done, need test
    offline analysis - convert cnmf results to .mat file - done

2. deal with zoom - check
3. mark point setting for changing photostim power - done
    control voltage = (outMax/displayMax)*PV value; where outMax and displayMax are defined in prairie view configuration.xml
    need to map power to voltage - done
    send volt to pockels via ni card -  consider outsource it to holoblink?

4. Plot STA dF/F - send triggers - check
5. threshold sometimes becomes Inf - check
6. auto initialisation - take reference movie and load - done
7. photostim protocol - done, need to test on rig
8. delete target by right clicking  - done by left click
9. some memory leak - every time the app is run, memory increases by ~3-4 % - mostly solved by explicit deleting of big variables
10. release gpu memory after one movie - done
11. daq task issues - 'the specified resource is reserved error' - this only happens when triggering online; need to restart spyder after one run
12. add option to save out motion-corrected movie by image-saver and by worker (when online photostim is not enabled) - done
13. save out detected events in ROIs for making trigger-triggered average frames -- done in matlab (post-hoc)
14. calibration check - done, make a button for it!
15. select photostim targets that are not detected by caiman
17. add live scan and/or single scan to make calcheck or target selection easier - added drag and drop 

11. daq task issues - 'the specified resource is reserved error' - this only happens when triggering online; need to restart spyder after one run
- solved by reset writer everytime.

16. deal with photostim artifect:
	- currently frames during photostim were not fed to caiman; sometimes a photostim frame breaks through, probably because of delay somewhere; caiman cell detection is not affected by the one-frame artifect and the abrupt jump in signal is filtered out in the denoised trace.
