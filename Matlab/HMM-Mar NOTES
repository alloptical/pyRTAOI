MAR model:
	predict the multichannel signal value at each time point as a linear combination of signal values at previous time points

Viterbi path:
	the most likely sequence of states
	This is conceptually different to the state time course, which instead relates to the sequence of states that are individually the most probable
	The Viterbi path is a not-probabilistic assignment - each time point a categorical assignment to one and only one state

Number of states K:
	fix the maximum number, and then the Bayesian inference process can discard some of them if there is insufficient evidence to support their presence in the data. 
	The free energy, a quantity that approximates the model evidence, can also be used to choose K.
	an information criterion, not a biological one


TO DO:

1. Algorithm:
	hmm-mar usese forward-backward, need to change to forward only

2. likelihood estimation:
	this is done by obslike.m

	need to make an online version of this -  estimate for current time point t

	- done a draft in get_current_gamma

	

	regressed = ones(1,num_channels);
